Congrats! You’ve been hired to work at javapic, the latest and greatest startup
in Portland! We’re a small company that focuses on developing and enriching
cloud-based communities by empowering visual storytelling.

Our site is pretty gorgeous right now, but we’re missing some pizazz. That’s
where you come in! You’ve been hired to add Javascript to our pages.
We want a Jumbotron that automatically loops through some of our images
every 20 seconds, a login form that won’t let users continue until their inputs
are correct, and a gallery that is auto-populated with all the images in the
folder. When an image is clicked, it should show up larger, and clicking
anywhere on the page should remove the larger preview.
