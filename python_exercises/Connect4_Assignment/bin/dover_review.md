Hello! Amazing job  on your connect four!
Controller:
L14: Old code
Model:
L8-9: Amazing colored checkers!
L59-61: If the user puts in 0 it makes makes col_num False.
Also nothing happens when you put an invalid input in, 
it doesn’t say it was incorrect and it 
still counts it as a turn.  
If you added something so it says
it’s invalid and makes them put their input in 
again I think it should fix everything!
View:
L68: Forgot the space after the sentence
Very clean code! I’m honestly very jealous of your checkers they are amazing ^-^
